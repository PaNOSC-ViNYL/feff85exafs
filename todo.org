* The feff85exafs to do list

** feffpath library [8/10]

 1. [X] write header into ~f3ffNNNN.dat~ files
 2. [X] deg --> degen to match larch's _feffdat group
 3. [ ] use polarization correctly in feffpath library (fix
    test_materials.py around line 56)
 4. [X] +capture rat and ipot from STRUCT+, accumulate ipot and rat
    wrappers as part of call to add_scatterer, also geom for python wrapper
 5. [X] capture a list of Z numbers so ipots can be readily translated
    to atomic species
 6. [X] capture header information in C struct, propagated into wrappers
 7. [ ] capture information about muffin tin radii, norman radii,
    ionization, a l√° Larch _feffdat's potentials attribute
 8. [X] check for existance/readability of phase.bin at level of
    feffpath.c
 9. [X] python wrapper / Larch plugin
 10. [X] nose testing for feffpath generated ~f3ffNNNN.dat~ files

** big jobs [0/2]

 1. [ ] fit with different feff versions -- comparison framework
 2. [ ] library for encapsolating generation of ~phase.bin~
