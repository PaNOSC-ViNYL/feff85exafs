* The feff85exafs to do list [3/10]

 1. [ ] write header into ~f3ffNNNN.dat~ files
 2. [ ] use polarization correctly in feffpath library (fix
    test_materials.py around line 56)
 3. [ ] capture rat and ipot into STRUCT, propagate to wrappers
 4. [ ] capture a list of Z numbers so ipots can be readily translated
    to atomic species
 5. [ ] capture header information in C struct, propagated into wrappers
 6. [X] check for existance/readability of phase.bin at level of
    feffpath.c (need to learn how to use fopen or whatever, see line 212)
 7. [X] python wrapper / Larch plugin
 8. [X] nose testing for feffpath generated ~f3ffNNNN.dat~ files
 9. [ ] fit with different feff versions -- comparison framework
 10. [ ] library for encapsolating generation of ~phase.bin~
