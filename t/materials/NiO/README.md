# Feff85EXAFS example: NiO

This is a data-bearing example (or, it will be once Bruce measures the
NiO data), thus the tests will cover both the computation and the
results of the analysis.


NiO is a simple transition metal oxide in the rock-salt structure.
This is intended as a slightly more complex example than copper metal.
The XAS data are measured at the Ni K edge.

The NiO sample was kindly provided by Neil Hyatt and Martin Stennett,
Sheffield University and measured by Bruce at NSLS X23A2.
