# Feff85EXAFS example: 1-bromoadamantane

This is a data-bearing example, thus the tests will cover both the
computation and the results of the analysis.

Bromoadamantane is a single-bonded, 10-carbon frame with hydrogen
atoms accommodating the remaining charge on the carbon atoms.  One
hydrogen atom is replaced with a bromine atom.  The XAS data are
measured at the Br K edge.

This is an interesting analysis problem because the Br-H scattering
plays a significant and easily measurable role in the EXAFS analysis.
