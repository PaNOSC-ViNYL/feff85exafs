# Content of the GENFMT folder

This directory contains routines for generalized F matrix
calculations, as described in
[the 1990 Rehr-Albers paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.41.8139).

All routines in this directory are covered by the [LICENSE](../HEADERS/license.h)

This directory also contains the Fortran subroutine `onepath.f` which
combines the F-matrix caluclation of `GENFMT/genfmt.f` with the
presentation of F-effective from `FF2X/feffdt.f`.  The `onepath`
subroutine can be called with a specified path geometry and it will
return the columns of the `feffNNNN.dat` file as arrays.  Optionally,
it can also write out a `feffNNNN.dat` file or a JSON file containing
all information from the `feffNNNN.dat` file.

Also here is a C wrapper around `onepath.f` called `feffpath.c`.  This
is compiled into `libfeffpath.so`.  `feffpath.h` defines a struct
containing all the information found in a `feffNNNN.dat` file.  See
[wrappers/C/makepath.c](../../wrappers/C/makepath.c) for an example of
the use of the C wrapper in a C program.

The C library can be wrapped for use in other languages.
[Here's a use of the perl wrapper as an example.](../../wrappers/perl/examples/pathsdat.pl)

# Build and install

To build, type `scons`.  This will build:

 * `libgenfmt.f`: most of the functionality of genfmt
 * `genfmt`: the stand-alone program
 * `libonepath.so`: the Fortran entry point for generating a single path
 * `libfeffpath.so`: the C wrapper around onepath
 * `feffpath_wrap.c` and `FeffPath.pm`: the SWIG wrapper for perl around feffpath

Once built, type `scons install` to install everything:

 * `libgenfmt.f`, `libonepath.so`, `libfeffpath.so`: installed to `/usr/local/lib`
 * `genfmt`: installed to `/usr/local/bin`
 * `feffpath_wrap.c` and `FeffPath.pm`: installed to `../../wrappers/perl`

You **must** install before building the Perl wrapper.  Other wrappers
almost certainly require at least that `libfeffpath.so` be installed.
