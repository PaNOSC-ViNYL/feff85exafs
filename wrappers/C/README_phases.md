# Using the feffpath C wrapper

The program `makephases.c` will read from `libpotph.json` (this
example is made from a `feff.inp` file for copper metal) and write the
`phase.pad` file.

The `makephases.c` program likely will not compile before you build and
install feff85exafs.  The build script will look for the `feffphases`
library and the `feffphases.h` header file in their installation
locations

To compile the `makephases` sample programs:

	~> scons

That's it!

## Sample program

Here is the simplest program using the C wrapper:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "feffphases.h"

int main()
{
  int i, ret;
  FEFFPHASES *phases;

  phases = malloc(sizeof(FEFFPHASES));
  ret = create_phases(phases);

  strcpy(phases->jsonfile, "../fortran/libpotph.json");
  ret = read_libpotph_json(phases);
  if (ret > 0) {
    printf("%s (error code %d)\n", phases->errormessage, phases->errorcode);
  } else {
    make_phases(phases);
  }

  cleanup(phases);
  free(phases);
  return 0;
}

```

1. The `feffphases.h` header file is included.

2. A FEFFPHASES struct is created and called `phases`.  Memory is
   allocated for it.

3. The call to `create_phases` allocates memory for all elements of the
   struct and initializes everything.

4. The `jsonfile` attribute of the struct is set to the location of
   the `libpotph.json` file, then it is read and imported into the
   struct.

5. If no problems are found among the input data, the `phase.pad` file
   is calcuated and written to disk.

6. Finally, the memory for `phases` is deallocated and the program
   terminates.

Note, where appropriate, these parameters are in natural units
(Angstrom and eV).  They will be converted to code units (Bohr and
Hartree) by the library.

The error code and message will be 0 and an empty string when no
errors are found.

### Attributes to consider trimming

1. `iafolp`: this may not be needed in the struct, the folp array gets filled
2. does the polarization and ellipticity info have any impact on the phases?
3. is spin to be supported in feff85exafs?
